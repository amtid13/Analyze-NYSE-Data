# Analyze-NYSE-Data

In this project, I calculated summary statistics, drawing any inference from the statistics, calculating business metrics, and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies. The goal was to perform an analysis and also create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways.

This repository contains two files: one to a powerpoint presentation, the other to my google sheet analysis and forecast - dropdown boxes have been implemented to change ticker symbol(s).
